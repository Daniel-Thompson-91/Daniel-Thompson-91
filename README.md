# About Me

## Who am I?
Hi, I’m Daniel Thompson (gitHub @Daniel-Thompson-91) (LinkedIn @danielthompson91). I am 31 years old (as of July 19, 2022). I am an avid outdoorsman and love to fish, hike, kayak, swim, and just about anything outdoor/adventure related. I also play various musical isntruments and occasionally do some singing.

I have been coding off and on for most of my life. I took a computer class in 9th grade where I began learning HTML and CSS, and I **loved** it! I have done many things throughout my life, but I keep finding myself coming back to coding.

## What are my current goals?
- ### Strengthening my knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
As I said above, I have worked with HTML and CSS off and on since 9th grade. I have only fairly recently started learning JavaScript, but I have been catching on pretty quickly. As a part of this goal, I’m currently going through Codecademy's Full Stack Software Engineer career path. On this path, I will be learning JavaScript, React, Node, SQL, Git/GitHub, and I will be refreshing my knowledge on HTML and CSS. Upon completeing each language along this path, I will recieve a certificate of completion for the language completed.

- ### Becoming a web developer
I would like to pursue either front-end, back-end, or full stack. I would also be interested in software development, but that will require some more learning/study on my part. I believe I am at a level where I could be an asset as a junior Developer, and I feel that I could learn more effectively as an active part of a web dev team.

- ### Moving to the Sacramento area
I am making a pretty big move from the East Texas area to the Sacramento area for personal reasons. I'm not sure how long I'll be there, but the goal is to move around the end of October this year. I will need a good, steady job in oder to afford California living, which is why I am actively studying to improve my tech stack and land a job as a developer.



I am open to do freelance work. If you have a personal project that you need/want help with, I would be more than happy to work along side you. Feel free to reach out on my LinkedIn profile (@danielthompson91).
