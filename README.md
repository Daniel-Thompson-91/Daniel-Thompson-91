# About Me

## Who am I?
Hi, Iâ€™m Daniel Thompson (gitHub @Daniel-Thompson-91) (LinkedIn @danielthompson91). I am 31 years old (as of July 19, 2022). I am an avid outdoorsman and love to fish, hike, kayak, swim, and just about anything outdoor/adventure related. I also play various musical isntruments and occasionally do some singing.

I have been coding off and on for most of my life. I took a computer class in 9th grade where I began learning HTML and CSS, and I **loved** it! I have done many things throughout my life, but I keep finding myself coming back to coding.

## What are my current goals?
- ### Strengthening my knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
As I said above, I have worked with HTML and CSS off and on since 9th grade. I started focusing on javaScript in July 2022. As a part of this goal, I recently completed Codecademy's Front End Engineer Career Path. On this path, I learned JavaScript, React, Node, Git/GitHub, and I strengthened my knowledge of HTML and CSS.

- ### Becoming a web developer
I would like to pursue a career in front end development/engineering or software engineering. I believe I am at a level where I could be an asset as a junior Developer, and I feel that I could learn more effectively as an active part of a web dev team.


I am open to do freelance work. If you have a personal project that you need/want help with, I would be more than happy to work along side you. Feel free to reach out on my LinkedIn profile (@danielthompson91).
